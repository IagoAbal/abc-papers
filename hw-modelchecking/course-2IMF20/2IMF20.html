<H1>2IMF20 Hardware Verification</H1>


<p> Welcome to the course pages of 2IMF20 Hardware Verification! </p>

<p> Lectures are every Tue. 13:30--15:15 in TR VAN TRIER and every Thu. 08:45--10:30 in AUD 13.</p> 

<p> Examination is on November 6th from 9:00 to 12:00 in room TBA. </p>

<p> On this website you will find materials like slides, assigments, and pointers to papers. 
Regarding papers, we will point to the publisher website. 
The TU/e digital library should give you access to these papers. Let me know if you have troubles 
downloading any paper. </p> 

<p> The teaching materials will consist of lecture notes (short) and slides. Still, I used (at least) the 
following three books to prepare the lectures:
  <ul>
    <li> <b> Formal verification: An essential toolkit for modern VLSI design</b> by Sleligman, Schubert, and Kumar</li>
    <li> <b> Model Checking </b>, by Clarke, Grumberg, and Peled</li>
    <li> <b> Principles of model checking</b> by Baier and Katoen</li>
  </ul>
The first one is very practical. That would be my first suggestion. The second one has more theoretical background 
but is still short and focused. The third one is theoretically oriented. It covers many topics and is therefore
quite thick. Its advantage that it contains (almost) everything.
</p>

<p>Note that these books are mentioned to give you pointers. It is absolutely not mandatory to buy them. But, if like me you like books, then having one will not hurt ! </p>

<hr>

<H2>Pre-requisities</H2>

<p>The course will do its best to be self-contained. But, we assume you are familiar with:
  <ul>
    <li>Basic logic and set theory concepts (like propositional logic and possibly modal logics)</li>
    <li>Basic knowledge of algorithms (depth-first, breadth-first, etc)</li>
  </ul> 

  If you have a bachelor in Computer Science, you should have most of these pre-requisites.
</p>

<p>  Relevant bachelor courses 
  tought in Eindhoven would be Logic and Set Theory, Computer Systems, Automata and Process Theory, Data Structures and Algorithms. </p>

  <p>
  At the master level, related courses are Automated Reasoning, System Validation, Algorithms for Model Checking, Process algebra, Program verification techniques, VLSI Programming, Electronic Design Automation, Digital circuit design.</p>

<hr>

<H2>Practical Assignments</H2>

<p> You will here find two preparation exercises. These 
exercises are meant for you to practice and learn necessary
knowledge before tackling the design project (see below).
These exercises will not be graded. Solutions will be discussed
during lectures.</p>

  <ul>

    <li> <b> Verifying communication fabrics with Cadence JasperGold </b> The second 
    exercise is about using Cadence JasperGold to prove correctness of a small design. 
    The text of the assignment is <a href="p02_jg_comfab_2018.pdf"> here</a>.
    <a href="allprim_js_solution.v"> Here</a> is a possible solution. The solution
    is not perfect but gives an idea about how to write basic assertions. 
    </li>
   <li> <b> Combinatioral Equivalence Checking with SAT </b>
      The first exercise is about reading two circuits and generating a CNF 
      file that is SAT if and only the circuits are different.
      Please follow this <a href="assignment2.html"> link</a> to start 
      this assignment.
      </li>
  </ul> 

<p> You will find here the design project: 
 <ul>

    <li> <b> Processor verification with JasperGold </b> 
    The third assignment is about using Jasper and System Verilog
    Assertions to verify a simple 8-bit microprocessor. The description
    of the assignment is <a href="assignment_jg_alu.pdf">here</a>. 
    The deadline for handing-in your solution if <b> Monday October
    22nd, 2018 at noon</b>. No extension will be granted. To help you with the assignment
    you can use the following template: 
     <ul>      
      <li> Template design for the processor <a href="core8_template.v"> 
      core8_template.v</a> </li>
    </ul>
    </li>    
  </ul> 
</p>



<p> You fill find here papers describing NoC architectures. If you feel 
you need to be more challenged in this course, you can select 
one of these designs instead of the processor described above.

<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://scinapse.io/papers/2111927499">Spidergon</a>: this is one of the first industrial proposal
  for a Network-on-Chip. Simple but has interesting way to scale up.</li>
  <li> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167926004000185?via%3Dihub">HERMES</a>: this is one of the first academic proposal.</li>
  <li> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2555312">Tornado</a>: recent academic design. Ring network with
  interesting features to avoid deadlock. </li>
  <li> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2400682.2400696">Ligero</a>: recent academic design. Ring network where 
  packets never stop travelling, somehow similar to hot-patato routing. </li>
</ul>

<p> We will continue the lecture about Bounded Model Checking. </p>



<hr>

<H2> Thursday 27.09.2018</H2>

<p> Here are slides about the Kripke 
semantics for LTL and CTL: <a href="2IMF20_Lecture04_part2.pdf">Slides</a>.
  We will then cover symbolic model-checking with BDD's.
  Next week, we will continue with SAT-based bounded model-checking. 
The slides about Symbolic and SAT-based bounded model-checking are  
<a href="2IMF20_Lecture05.pdf">here</a>. 
Chapter-5 of the reader above covers these topics. </p>

<p> <b> Reading Assignment </b> Here is the original paper about bounded model 
checking. The lecture is basically based on this paper:

  <ul>
    <li> <a href="https://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCMQFjAAahUKEwjch-z6if7HAhUBoiwKHXNzCnM&url=http%3A%2F%2Ffmv.jku.at%2Fpapers%2FBiereCimattiClarkeZhu-TACAS99.pdf&usg=AFQjCNGEFrSeZT8dw8fJBV77sUxBmA-Ijg"> Symbolic Model Checking Without BDDs</a> by Biere et al. </li>
  </ul>

</p>


<hr>

<H2> Tuesday 25.09.2018</H2>

<p> 
  We will cover temporal logics (LTL and CTL). 
  Slides are 
<a href="2IMF20_Lecture04.pdf">here</a>. 
These slides correspond to Chapter 4 of the reader above. </p>

<hr>

<H2> Thursday 20.09.2018</H2>

<p> ** Bring your laptops ! ** 
We will then make groups and give logins and passwords for the server. 
You are required to work in teams of 2 or 3 students. 
This is mainly due to the limited 
number of licenses (20) for Jasper Gold. We will give a short demo about 
the tool Jasper Gold and System Verilog Assertions. 
You will then work on the second preparation exercise, namely, 
a tutorial to Jasper Gold. 

Below, you will find some materials about System Verilog Assertions:
  <ul>
    <li> A short <a href="bsnug04_ecker_esen_kruse_steininger_jensen.pdf"> document</a> 
    that is a bit old, but still seems like a good way to start </li>
    <li> Some <a href="SvaFvTutorialHVC2013.pdf"> slides</a> about a more 
    recent tutorial. The slides make a nice link between LTL and
      SVAs. You do not need to read the entire set of slides. We will cover
      LTL next week. 
      You can stop at page 70/118. </li>
  </ul>

<p> ** NO LECTURE **. </p>

<hr>

<H2> Thursday 13.09.2018</H2>

<p> We continued about reachability, SEC, and BDD's. We will have a quick
look at the solutions to the first preparation exercise. We also 
talked about reachability using k-induction and SAT. For more detail 
about this, please look at section IV of the paper 
titled "SAT-solving in practice" below.</p>

<p> <b> Reading Assignment </b> Here is a good paper summarizing the use of BDDs 
in hardware verification, a good definition of the k-induction principle, 
and a paper summarizing the practice of SAT solving. 
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~ajh/mypapers/97H1.ps.gz"> 
    "Formal Hardware Verification with BDDs: An Introduction"</a> by A. Hu.</li>

<H2> Tuesday 11.09.2018</H2>

<p> We will check how things are going with the first preparation exercise. 
  We will then have a look at the basics of SAT solvers. 
  A description of the SAT algorithm can also be found in Section 2.2. of 
  Chapter 2 above. 
  The slides about SAT are <a href= "BMC-lecture_slides_SAT.pdf"> here</a>. 
Finally, we will discuss sequential equivalence checking
and reachability using BDD's. 
BDD's are detailed in Section 2.1.5 of Chapter 2 above. 
We provide you with a reference below for the lecture materials. 
The slides about SEC are  <a href = "2IMF20_Lecture03_2018.pdf"> here.</a>
